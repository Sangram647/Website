    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <h3>Who Are We?</h3>
    <p>We love video games. We love them so much that we decided to sell them. We’re here to make gaming affordable.</p>
    <p>We are a small independent retailer that aims to provide value for money when it comes to digital games. Platforms like Steam, Origin, Uplay and even Xbox Live have great sales and deals – but only for selected periods of time. Our aim is to offer good deals all year round.</p>
    <p>We launched this website on April 1, 2020. Our goal is to provide any gamer with an opportunity to get acquainted with premium video games at an affordable price!</p>
    <h3>Our History</h3>
    <p>Digital Gamekeys originally started as an Amazon store in 2018 and since then we’ve sold thousands of games to thousands of gamers.

     When you buy a game from us you aren’t funding a massive organization that is based in a tax free country, you’re helping to provide jobs and careers to a small group of individuals.
     We appreciate every customer that chooses to buy from us and we endeavor to deliver the best service possible at the best price possible.</p>
     <h3>Our Product and service</h3>
     <p>When buying digital games we understand that trust is vital. We only buy stock from verified and authenticated wholesalers.

        When buying from us we guarantee that you will receive the following:
        
        A genuine working game key/code
        Key/code delivered via email within a maximum of 12 hours*
        A region free key/code – unless specifically stated otherwise
        Here is what we do NOT sell:
        
        Key/codes that require a VPN to activate and play
        Unauthorized key/codes that will be revoked at a later date
        Login information
        Pre-created accounts with games already activated
        We only sell games that you can activate/redeem to your own accounts. Once the game is activated to your account it will remain there indefinitely.
